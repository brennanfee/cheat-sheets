# cheat-sheets

Command-line cheat sheets and code snippets.

## Overview

This repo contains little command-line executions that I may use frequently or even just
from time-to-time. Unlike traditional cheat sheet like documents these are real world
examples not contrived samples. As a result, all of these are verified to work and solve
some real problem or provide some real-world information.

## The cheat-sheets
